Works
-----
#. Run serval experiments for Re-id
	* RNN successfully work with a lower learning rate (1e-4).
	* Try different CNN models. Get pre-trained ResNet model.
#. Continue doing AI homework

Thoughts
-----
#. Data augmentation for Re-id
#. Change different optimizer
#. Data parallel!
#. Use all data training on classification task
