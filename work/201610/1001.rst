Countably Infinite
-----
* `Defination <http://mathinsight.org/definition/countably_infinite>`_: A set is countably infinite if its elements can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers.
* `Uncountable <http://mathinsight.org/definition/uncountable>`_
* `Cantor's diagonal argument <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_diagonal_argument>`_: proof of uncountable set.
	* Using infinite binary sequence
	* If :math:`s1 ... sn ...` is any enumeration of elements from :math:`T`, then there is always an element :math:`s` of :math:`T` which corresponds to no :math:`sn` in the enumeration
	* `Constructive proof <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructive_proof>`_: construct a sequence by inverting the diagnal of :math:`s1 ... sn ...` sequence array
	* `Proof by contradiction <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction>`_: assuming :math:`T` was countable. Then all its elements could be written as an enumeration s1, :math:`s1 ... sn ...`. Applying the previous theorem to this enumeration would produce a sequence s not belonging to the enumeration. However, :math:`s` was an element of :math:`T` and should therefore be in the enumeration.
* Also `Cantor's theorem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor%27s_theorem>`_
