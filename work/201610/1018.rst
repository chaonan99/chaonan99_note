`Person Re-Identification via Recurrent Feature Aggregation <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByS8YXR7ycXHU1ZwSXNPWUNtNFU/view>`_
^^^^^
* `Poster <http://www.eccv2016.org/files/posters/P-4A-22.pdf>`_
* Shanghai Jiao Tong University
* Video re-id
* No CNN, use LBP and color feature
* LSTM
* Classification output????????
* Datasets: iLIDS-VID (49.3%), PRID 2011 (58.2%)

`Deep Attributes Driven Person Re-identification <http://www.eccv2016.org/files/posters/P-1B-34.pdf>`_
^^^^^
* Attribute + deep network based
	* Train on attribute
	* Finetune on attribute triplet loss
	* Final finetuning with re-id dataset
* Datasets: VIPeR (43.5%), PRID image (22.6%), Market (Single: 39.4%, multiple: 49.0%)

`A Siamese Long Short-Term Memory
Architecture for Human Re-Identification <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.08381v1.pdf>`_
^^^^^
* Divide image into several horizontal stripes, represent as a sequence.
* LSTM progressively take each horizontal stripes as inputs (first siamese architecture with LSTM)
* 
* Datasets: Market-1501 (), CUHK03 (), VIPeR ()
