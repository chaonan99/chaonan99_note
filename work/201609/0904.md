# 4th September, Sunday

## Works
1. Continue debugging train.lua script.
2. Make baseline running now!!!
3. Pass overfit test. Again, **NO DROPOUT IN TESTING!!!!**

## Problems
1. Baseline model still can't pass overfit, API and gradCheck test (almost all of them...). Need to check them.

## TODOs
1. Move on to temporal segmentation model.
2. Read report and ResNet paper!!!
