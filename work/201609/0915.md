## Thoughts
1. Learn web development from [this great post](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/the-practical-guide-to-becoming-a-professional-web-developer-2f255bc25c90#.lgw2xrsqz)
	+ Task 1: [pomodoro clock](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-pomodoro-clock) (Interesting!!!) ([pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique))
	+ Task 2: [book trading club](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/manage-a-book-trading-club) (Not now...)
	+ Task 3: WeChat server back to life...
	+ Task 4: beautiful LaTex render server! (Maybe difficult but worth trying)
2. Check out how to [run a program at startup](http://www.howtogeek.com/228467/how-to-make-a-program-run-at-startup-on-any-computer/)
3. Code rating site [TOIBE](http://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).
4. [FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp). I think it's more job-oriented. Remember this yet don't stick to it at this time.

## Works
1. Watch [JavaScript event loop video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=6&v=8aGhZQkoFbQ). [Project in this video](https://github.com/latentflip/loupe) available
2. Randomly learn some concepts

## Knowledge organization
+ [Knowledge organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_organization)
+ [Folksonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folksonomy). [Shorter explanation](http://www.degruyter.com/view/product/42362)
+ [Cranfield experiments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranfield_experiments). Related to [information retrieval evaluation](http://www.iva.dk/bh/Core%20Concepts%20in%20LIS/articles%20a-z/information_retrieval_evaluation.htm)

## Pomodoro
+ [Pomodoro Technique wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)
+ Steps
	1. Decide on the task to be done.
	2. Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).
	3. Work on the task until the timer rings. If a distraction pops into your head, write it down, but immediately get back on task.
	4. After the timer rings, put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
	5. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 1.
	6. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
+  A pomodoro is **indivisible**. When interrupted during a pomodoro, either the other activity must be recorded and postponed (inform – negotiate – schedule – call back) or the pomodoro must be abandoned.
+ Use a mechanical timer, paper and pencil (suggested by the creator).
