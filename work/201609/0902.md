# 2st September, Friday

## Randoms
1. Return lab key to the key office in central campus.
2. Visit school museum.
3. Really insipid cod in Fireside lunch today!

## Works
1. Successfully add gif using ffmpeg!
2. Polish dataset descriptions.
3. New note on Describing video by ... paper. Have read it before.
4. Working on the code

## Problems with s2vt model
1. Encoder should be no-output lstm?
2. See the last hidden state as encoder output?
3. How to deal with that hidden state? To view as the input to decoder or previous state to decoder? (That will result in different length of decoder RNN!)
	* If viewing as the input, same as the image caption model.
	* If viewing as initial hidden state, much more difficult and tricky.
4. Switch to _createZeroTensor mechanism. (Finally know how his code can be compatible with cpu and gpu!)
5. Put functions into one LSTM file.
