## Thoughts
1. Random initialize hidden state to avoid symmetry?
2. Different batch_size in sample and updateOutput in LanguageModel.lua, Neuraltalk2!

## Works
1. Finish baseline code and debugging
	* Encoder part is correct. Gradient checked.
	* 

## Problems
1. Language can't pass gradient check relative error with 1e-4 accuracy, only pass 1e-3 accuracy.
	* 2-layer gets even worse gradient.
