## Works
1. Talk about the baseline with Luowei.
2. Change baseline to input the encoded video representation into every time step of decoder.
3. Fix more bug in videosample.py (That's really a rubbish!!! No such solution anymore!!!).

## Problems
1. New model can't pass gradCheck (great bias!). Maybe I need to check decoder independently.
