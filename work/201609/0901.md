# 1st September, Thursday

# Works
1. Work with dataset description.
2. Attempt to add a gif to Latex2Picture project, but not familiar with Premiere. Waste the whole night and end up using ffmpeg...

## Readings
1. Re-read Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Encoder paper and take notes.

##Thoughts

1. Begin working with technical report.
	* Re-read video/image caption paper, summarize the introduction, related work parts
	* Persist on writing paper review. Collect those summary to form the final report.
2. Set a dataset description, just like paper notes for the convenience of looking up. Should add paper links who use this dataset.
