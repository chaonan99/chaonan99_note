Works
-----
#. Update system
#. Whole day trying to make the model converge, failed

TODOs
-----
#. Evaluation

Possible problem?
-----
#. CNN, pre-train maybe useless?
#. Resize? Kelei says it may not be influential
#. Program bug?

Lessons
-----
#. In torch, :getParameters() and :cuda() will reshuffle memory around. Clones should be done after these two functions.
