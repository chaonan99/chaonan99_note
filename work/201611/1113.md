# 13th November, Sunday

## Notes
We are working on CVPR 2017 these days. Recently I found myself becoming lazier and lazier, stopping writing daily notes, meeting notes, not reading paper for a long time and never taking lecture note since October. It takes great effort to stick on something, yet try something new is always easy. I always think I should try something new every day even if I cannot finish my work on time, to get prepared for uncertain future. But now I should change my mind. I am not a multi-thread person, who can only focus on one thing at a time. Anyway, find the life I've lost. Currently, hold on to learn OpenGL and do application every day is the most important.
