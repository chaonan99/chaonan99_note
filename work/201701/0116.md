## Contextual RNN-GANs for Abstract Reasoning Diagram Generation
* Use GAN to answer IQ question!
    * Should be similar image
    * Should be correct answer
* Contextual means not only put the answer to discriminator, but also input image sequence, yet use RNN.

* Questions:
    * How do you demonstrate the network can learn correct, not only similar images? The difference between correct and incorrect but similar pattern is small and may not be reacted on L2 loss.
    * Siamese? Already seen the ground truth? Pre-trained or end-to-end?

## Coherent Dialogue with Attention-based Language Models
* Unstructured Multi-Turn Dialogue

* Questions
    * Nothing special in the model. Does the architecture really matter???
