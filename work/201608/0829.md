## Questions and TODOs
1. Should find out why sample returns 20 same sentences for msr-vtt.
	* Return `batch_size` sentences. Shouldn't set `batch_size` as `seq_per_img`!
2. Why preprocessing images?
3. Pre-training with mini-batch is ok.
4. Design of attention lstm has some problems.
	* Shouldn't put `seq_per_video`, `frame_per_video` into LSTM parameter!!!

## Paper Reading
1. [Recurrent Models of Visual Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.6247v1.pdf).
