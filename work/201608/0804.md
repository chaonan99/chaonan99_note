# 4th August, Thursday

## Works
1. Coming up with some new idea: using GAN on the model or do some work on text to image.
2. Trouble with the website... because the server crushed...
3. Solve the problem and update the README file of v2t website project which gives a solution to this problem.
4. Polish the work on attention model. Share the code on [gist](https://gist.github.com/chaonan99/766341e72c63763e028eab9428587f24)

## Thoughts
1. Further improve vtt model (maybe lots of experiments)
	* Pre-training on other dataset, like MS COCO
	* Add audio information in attention model
	* Still overfitting, so parameter can be improved further
	* Beam search

2. New topic on text to image
	* Can use most of the works, like attention model
	* Hot topic on GAN
	* Method can transfer to vtt

## Next Week Goal
* Get all the work done aforementioned in T&M->1 (this week)
* Implement DRAW  model and see if we can add something new (before the next meeting)
