# 9th August, Tuesday

## Works
1. Download TGIF dataset (write a download script)
2. Write pre-processing script to convert .gif file and caption into an hdf5 file.
	a. Convert .gif to pictures (Done)
	b. Pre-processing script to generate a json file of the picture info.
	c. Use `prepro.py` in *NeuralTalk2* to generate .hdf5 and .json file (don't know why should we have step b...)

## TODO list
1. Pre-processing script to generate a json file of the picture info.
2. Make some changes to `prepro.py` in **NeuralTalk2** to generate .hdf5 and .json file for video caption use.
3. Change the architechture of the LSTM to support **pyramid structure**.
4. Read the most recent paper about multimodal approach to image caption translation.
5. Read **Resnet paper**.
