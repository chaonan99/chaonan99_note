## Works
1. Finish TGIF. Generate a ready-to-use hdf5 dataset.
2. Attention visualize. Find something interesting:
	* Similar frames have similar weights and different frames have different ones. This suggests that attention is doing something like segmentation.
	* Slight difference between time steps. Relevent frames may have more weights when generate a word.
	* Frames containing more information will have more weights.

## TODOs
1. Really visualize attention (histogram)
2. LSTMvis
