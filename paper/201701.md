## Video-based Person Re-identification withAccumulative Motion Context
* [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.00193.pdf)

### Highlight
* Two stream: spacial + temporal (optical flow).
* Use a motion network pre-trained on optical flow to predict OF and also learn end-to-end in training phase.
* Fuse spacial and temporal feature in the middle.
* Multiloss: siamese reid and classification loss.

### Model
