* Current state-of-the-art on [Market-1501](201609.md#market-1501).

### Contribution
1. Architecture of baseline siamese network for person re-id.
2. Matching gate between convolutional blocks.

### Matching gate (MG) structure
* Feature summarization
	* Aggregates the local feature along a horizontal stripe.
	* Deal with problem of changed view point (view point change in re-id typically in the horizontal direction, same parts are very likely to be along the same horizontal region).
	* Equation and dimention:
		`y_{r1}=f(w*x_{r1})`; `y_{r2}=f{w*x{r2}}`
		where `x_{ri}\in \mathbb{R}^{1\times c\times h}` is the `r^{th}` row of feature map. `w\in \mathbb{R}^{1\times c\times h\times h}` (maybe `\mathbb{R}^{1\times c\times 1\times h}`) and `y_{r1}\in \mathbb{R}^{1\times 1\times h}` (maybe `\mathbb{R}^{1\times 1\times h\times h}`).
* Feature similarity
	* Euclidean distance of `y_{r1}` and `y_{r2}`
		`g_r^i=\exp(\frac{-(y_{r1}^i-y_{r2}^i)^2}{p_i^2})`
		where `g_r \in \mathbb{R}^{1\times 1\times h}`
	* `p_i` decides the variance of the Gaussian function, learnable, should set a higher initial value.
* Filtering and boosting the features
	* Repeat `g_r` c times horizontally to obtain `G_r\in \mathbb{1\times c\times h}`.
	* Add filtered feature to original feature.
		`a_{r1}^i=x_{r1}^i+x_{r1}^i\odot G_r^i`
		`a_{r2}^i=x_{r2}^i+x_{r2}^i\odot G_r^i`
	* Perform L2 normalization across channels after this

### Result
* Dataset: Market-1501, CUHK-03, VIPeR.
* Baseline S-CNN outperform most CNN approaches. With MG gaining further improvement.
* Visualization of gate. Low gate activation means low similarity.
