* **Description** This dataset is a collection of Youtube clips collected on Mechanical Turk by requesting workers to pick short clips depicting a single activity. The videos were then used to elicit single sentence descriptions from annotators. The original corpus has multi-lingual descriptions. This dataset contends multiple language.

* **Scale** 1970 clips (train/validate/test:1200/100/670), 80k clip-description pairs (multi-language)

* Description: The Tumblr GIF (TGIF) dataset contains 100K animated GIFs and 120K sentences describing visual content of the animated GIFs. The animated GIFs have been collected from Tumblr, from randomly selected posts published between May and June of 2015. We provide the URLs of animated GIFs in this release. The sentences are collected via crowdsourcing, with a carefully designed annotation interface that ensures high quality dataset. We provide one sentence per animated GIF for the training and validation splits, and three sentences per GIF for the test split. The dataset shall be used to evaluate animated GIF/video description techniques.
