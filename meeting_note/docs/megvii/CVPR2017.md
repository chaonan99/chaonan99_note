## Deep Learning Goes 3D, Haoqiang Fan
* Human can get 3D visual impact in 2D image
* How to represent 3D shape
    - Depth map? Does not work (obstacle)
    - Triangle mesh? Too complicate for deep NN
* Our approach: Points
* ShapeNet: generated
* Implementation details
    * Loss function: EMD mean, CD mean
* Human performance

## Image Semantic Segmentation, Chao Peng
* Why segmentation?
    * ADAS
    * Medical
    * Front background
* Current methods
    * FCN
    * Problem: valid receptive field
* Global convolutional network

## Deep Text Detection without Bells and Whistles, Tim
* Problem in OCR
    * Traditional, simple layout style and font
    * In the wild
    * Hierarchy
* Old school methods
* Our pipline
    * Score map
    * Geometry map
    * NMS

## What Can Help Pedestrain Detection, Tete Xiao, Jiayuan Mao
* What can help? Segmentation, edge, heat map, optical flow, depth map
* Segmentation, edge contains fine-grained semantic information
