# chaonan99 Note
A notebook for my work, lecture note and paper reading note. This is just a continuation of my previous LabNotebook, and has been developing into a [knowledge organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_organization) project. See [intuition](#intuition) for more details.

## Meeting
Meeting and work stuff.

## Work
Every day work note. Currently knowledge database is also hold here.

## Lecture
Lecture note is also hold on [Readthdocs](http://chaonan99-note.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Paper

> Please feel free to bring up your opinions for better solution or organization method, or directly make contributions to this section! (Actually they are still not well-organized to my point of view...)

Under `paper` folder, there will be two things: paper notes and dataset description. The README file under the folder is a [curation](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/content-curation) of all stuff and link to details.

### Paper notes

There will be a catalog in the README under `paper`, which links to the specific place of notes. Notes are taken cross time base and there will be a file every month. There will be a `paper link` to the `pdf` format on the Internet (typically in `http://arxiv.org`).

### Dataset Description

A catalog in README file under `paper` as well, linking to the real description place. Descriptions are fused with paper notes but as it is divided in the catalog, one can easily find them. There should be some basic introduction to the dataset, key feature and parameter and (optionally) some example data. Check those descriptions for more details.

## Intuition
My first attempt to organize my work is from my second semester of junior, when I'm working in the lab and lecture at the same time. Following is the details of my method.

* I use OneNote to organize my work.
* I paint items in different colors, which represent class work, lab work, self-realization work and recreation respectively. This gives a visualization of how much time I've spent on different things.
* I make a page for every week, with a TODO list on the top (typically with a checkbox for each item), followed by everyday notes.

Unfortunately, I sometimes get lazy and can't stick to this rule. Besides, my supervisor in the lab asks us to take labnote. So I start to use git and markdown to take note. As I also take paper note on OneNote before, I transfer to git as well. So this project begins.

The thought of dataset description emerges during my paper reading. Many papers use the same dataset, but when you want to compare those result on the same dataset, you can't always find them. Thus I came up with the idea to **join the paper links under a dataset item**, along with some description. This is a great idea, but it's a huge project and highly unfinished. So I wonder how I can get help from others.

In new semaster, I also begin to take lecture note. This keeps me busy in the class and I extremely enjoy taking notes. Yet I'm also frequently learning about new concepts for myself. Those concepts are not systematic but equally important. So my new idea is to make use of some knowledge organization technique in this project to collect those tiny concepts.
