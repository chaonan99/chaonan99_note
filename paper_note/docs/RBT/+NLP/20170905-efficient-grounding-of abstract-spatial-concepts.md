## Knowledge
* Adaptive Distributed Correspondence Graph (ADCG)
* Physical workspace ($\Upsilon$).
* Groundings ($\Gamma$): the set of groundings consists of symbols that correspond to semantic notions (objects, locations, regions, paths, actions the robot can take).
* Input instructions ($\Lambda$): the set of phrases determined from a parse tree.

* Grounding natural language instructions
    * Concrete groundings: object, semantic labels (e.g. red block), manipulation actions, spatial references, cardinality, ordinal.
    * Abstract groundings: containers, attributes
