## NL Instruction Understanding
* See Table I in the paper.

* Literal models
    - Grammer model: Exhaustive listing of NL instructions
    - Association model: Find correlation between concrete concepts
* Interpreted models
    - Multi-modalities
    - Difficult to combine and extract feature, may have conflicts

## NL-Based Execution Plan Generation
* See Table II.

## Knowledge-World Mapping
* Theoretical knowledge grounding: map learned knowledge info corresponding objects and relations in real-world scenarios.
    * Applications: Properities -> real world entity, object searching
    * Still need predefinitionss
* Knowledge gap filling: detect and recommand missing knowledge / inconsistent knowledge.
