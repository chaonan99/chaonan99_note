## Centralized Approach
* Approaches Based on Heuristic Rules
    * Reservation scheme: divide road into cells which can hold only one car at a time
    * Other: some very early work
* Optimization and Control Approaches
    * Minimize travel time
    * Minimize vehicle overlap
    * Fuel consumption
    * Multi-objective (may include the risk of collision)

## Decentralized Approach
* Heuristic control
    * Virtual vehicle/platooning
    * Critical/Invariant set
* Optimization and Control Approaches
    * Multi-objective (commonly assume a desired configuration)

## Future Directions
* Optimizing vehicle operation at a large scale, rapid learning
* Combine driver feedback system and connected vehicles to provide instructions to the drivers
