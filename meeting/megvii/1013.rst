Meeting 1013
=====

Detection & Tracking
-----
* Replace different re-id model, finally use ckl's RNN model.
* MOT, global tracking -> batch, online tracking.
* Speed, still slow when extracting features for all proposal (2,3 fps, related to proposal number)
	* MOT16-04 2-3 fps, 40-50 bbs in one frame
	* MOT16-02 15fps, 20 bbs in one frame
* MegTracking
	* Frame extraction scheme in the current model does not match with real application
	* Before 15/11

Single Object Tracking
-----
* Object dataset. Have not found.

Attributes
-----
* Framework setup.
* Problem with dataset.
* Current performance on VGG
	* Child/Adult 87%
* Add skeleton for attributes
* AI:
	* P0:
		* Bag parsing (sjq:algorithm, zgy:data)
		* Backpack parsing (sjq)
	* P1:
		* Upper clothes style
		* Lower clothes style
		* Umbrella parsing

ReID
-----
* Attention GRU
	* CUHK03: 72% (128 channel), 61% (32 channel)
	* Replace concatenate with sum
* ResNet50+2FC
	* channel from 128 to 32 (51%->65%)
* Harm performance on classification after adding parsing

Body Parsing
-----
* Detection along with parsing

MegVideo
-----
* Benchmark
	* On PReID-S1
* Begin to design MegVideo 3.0
